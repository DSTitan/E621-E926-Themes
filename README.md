# E621 & E926 Themes
Custom themes I made for [e621](https://e621.net) and [e926](https://e926.net) that you can use.

### How to apply theme
You need to have an account on [e621](https://e621.net) or [e926](https://e926.net) to use custom themes.

- Open the file of the theme you want.
- Copy the CSS.
- Go to [e621](https://e621.net) or [e926](https://e926.net).
- Navicate to ` Acount > Settings > Advanced `
- Scroll to the bottom.
- Paste the CSS in ` Custom CSS style `
- Click ` Submit `

There you go, custom theme applied!
